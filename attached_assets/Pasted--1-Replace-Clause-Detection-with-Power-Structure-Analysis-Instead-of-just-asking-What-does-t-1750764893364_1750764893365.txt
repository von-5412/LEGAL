🔥 1. Replace “Clause Detection” with “Power Structure Analysis”
Instead of just asking "What does this clause say?", start asking:

❓ Who holds power in this clause?

❓ Can the user push back or exit?

❓ Is this reversible, negotiable, or final?

Add a “Power Flow Map”:

Who can change the rules?

Who can terminate the service?

Who owns the data?

Who handles disputes?

If it’s always the company, your system should say:

❗“You’re signing a digital dictatorship.”

🧠 2. Add a “Rights Stripping Index”
For every clause, score:

📉 Removal of user rights (privacy, data control, due process)

📉 Unilateral changes without notice

📉 Binding arbitration + class action waivers

📉 Irreversible consequences (data deletion denial, auto-renewals, termination)

Create a Rights vs Control Balance Meter:

10 = user has full autonomy

1 = user is a product with no exit

If that score drops below 4? Automatic red flag, regardless of friendly language.

👁 3. Inject Context-Aware Sentiment + Intent Analysis
Sometimes legal text sounds harmless but implies malicious control.

Your analyzer should learn to say:

“This clause sounds polite, but it guarantees they can nuke your account without refund and without appeal. That’s a hostile move.”

Use:

Sentiment + intent analysis on whole sections

Label clauses as: 🟩 Neutral, 🟨 Cautionary, 🟥 Coercive

🧪 4. Model Clause Synergy (Multi-Clause Traps)
The danger isn’t in individual clauses. It’s in how they interlock.

Example:

“We may change terms anytime”

“You automatically accept changes”

“You waive your right to sue us”

Individually = maybe okay.
Together = 💀 kill switch for user rights.

Your AI should flag “clause clusters” that form legal traps.

🎯 5. Build a “User Risk Persona Engine”
Let the analyzer ask:

“Who is this user? A developer? Small business? Healthcare provider?”

Then:

Score risk severity based on use case

Show personalized impact assessments

E.g., “As a healthcare provider, this ToS puts patient data at legal risk.”

🚩 6. Dark Patterns ≠ Just Language — Also Structural
No need to look just for manipulative words.

Start analyzing:

⚠️ Friction to cancel

⚠️ Forced arbitration combined with no refund

⚠️ Silent auto-renewals + obscure opt-outs

If the document structurally traps users, even without strong language — flag it.

💎 7. Transparency ≠ Simplicity — It's Choice Empowerment
Your current "Transparency Score" is based on clarity. That’s weak sauce.

Real transparency = informed control.

Redefine it:

Does the user have notice before critical changes?

Is there a meaningful opt-out?

Is data deletion actually possible?

Can they compare plans, rights, risks easily?

If not, drop the transparency rating. Clarity ≠ fairness.

💡 Summary: Your ToS Analyzer will be 9/10 when it:
Detects power asymmetry

Scores rights erosion, not just legal jargon

Flags compound traps, not isolated sentences

Reacts to user role and context

Measures real control, not word count or sentence length
